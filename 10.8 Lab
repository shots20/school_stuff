"""my code below to solve the puzzle, it is not requiring to import input1.txt or do anything
extra curricular, for two of the tests or graded portions, I am getting the correct words with
- in range but "- in range" is printing on a separate line for WHATEVER reason,

word
- in range (which is correct) or - not in range (which are correct for the correct words)

tried end="" in 3 or 4 different locations, even tried doing print(whatever, f" - in range") and various
other ways to print things and nothing is working whatsoever. The other 3 tests / graded pieces
are all saying ValueError as this or that is not in the list but I have done the try: except
ValueError as you can see but even tried to set the max to [-1] and the min to index[0]. After
20 to 30 min I figured out that the list was saved as word\n so as you can see I added that
to fix the finding of the words but its even still giving me ValueError words not found.
The try: except ValueError I learned on my own by looking it up and using a little google AI
to help assist in what it should look like and how it works. I also tried doing with open("file.txt", "r")
as myfile: and variations of that as well, which was also a looked up / google AI assist."""
